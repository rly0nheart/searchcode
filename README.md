- [x] Returns the raw data from a code file given the code id which can be found as the id in a code search result.
- [x] Returns an array of results given a searchcode unique code id which are considered to be duplicates.
- [ ] Saves results to a JSON file (coming soon...)

# TODO
- [ ] Create GUI

# Installation
## PyPI
searchcode-cli can be installed from pypi using the command:
```
pip install searchcode-cli
```
## Docker
Alternatively, you can pull the docker container from dockerhub by running the command:
```
docker pull rly0nheart/searchcode-cli
```
## Build From Source
Or if you wish to build searchcode-cli from source, you can follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/rly0nheart/searchcode-cli
```
**2. Move to searchcode-cli directory**
```
cd searchcode-cli
```
**3. Build the .whl file**
Before you start building the .whl, you should first install the build package (if you dont already have it)
```
pip install build
```
Once the build package is installed, you can now run the following command to start building:
```
python -m build
```
**4. Installing .whl**
When building is complete, you will now run the following command to install the built .whl
```
pip install dist/*.whl
```
This will look for a file with the .whl extension and install it

### Note
> On Windows, you will have to explicitly write the full filename of the .whl after dist\
